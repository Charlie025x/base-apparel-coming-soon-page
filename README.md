## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a good CSS grid refresher. I first created the project's mobile version using flexbox but then making the desktop version with flexbox was difficult. So I re-wrote my css with Grid, development went smoothly for the most part after that. For a moment the mobile website would break when I added a second "column" using "grid-template-column: 60% 30%" at the desktop's media query. I have no idea as to why that happened but I somehow fixed that bug.

### Continued development

Identifying whether to use flex or grid, keeping in mind how the web site changes from mobile to desktop size.
